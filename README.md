#NOTE - this is a fork of xolvio:md-blog.
We add features we need for our blog and send PRs back to Xolvio, but it's
their package, so you should probably go to the source. Special thanks to Sam and the entire Xolvio team!

##Additional features

###Versioning

Every time you click **Save**, a new version will be added to that post's History.

Click the History button on a post (or in the list) to view, restore, or delete versions.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the _entire_ blog post status gets saved - including it's Published status. If you restore an
old version that was Unpublished into a post that is Published, it will become Unpublished again, and you need
to re-publish it.
